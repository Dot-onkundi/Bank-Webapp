            <p>XFLIR believes that the prosperity of business and society is inextricably linked and as such investing in society generates a positive multiplier effect that will benefit society, the environment and the economy. To actualize this belief, XFLIR Kenya set up XFLIR Foundation to deliver a positive impact to society through social investment programs that create shared value for its stakeholders. The Foundationâ€™s program approach is to work through implementing partners to deliver the objectives of the Foundation by seeking to leverage and complement resources, skills, experiences, knowledge and track records of partner organizations in a catalytic and value-adding manner.</p>
